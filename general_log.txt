Generated Response:
The `cnn.py` file describes a convolutional neural network (CNN) within a class named `CNN`. According to the class's docstring, the network includes 3 fully connected layers. The details of these layers are specified as follows:

- First fully connected layer: 1024 units
- Second fully connected layer: 512 units
- Third fully connected layer: 10 units

To find this information, refer to the docstring description of the `CNN` class in `cnn.py`, particularly this portion: 

"Convolutional Neural Network with 3 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. Dropout is applied after each pooling layer and fully connected layer. filters: 64, 64, 128, 128, 256, 256 fully connected layers: 1024, 512, 10."

This clearly states that the neural network contains three fully connected layers with the specified sizes. The class is defined from line 61 to 103 within the file `cnn.py`.

Prompt: write a function to get a number as temperature in centigrade and change it to Fahrenheit
Result:
Here is a function in Python that takes a temperature in Celsius (Centigrade) and converts it to Fahrenheit:

```python
# Function to convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius):
    """This function converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit."""
    fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
    return fahrenheit
```

You can use this function by passing a temperature value in Celsius as an argument, and it will return the temperature converted to Fahrenheit. For example:

```python
temp_celsius = 25
temp_fahrenheit = celsius_to_fahrenheit(temp_celsius)
print(f"The temperature in Fahrenheit is {temp_fahrenheit}�F")
```

This will output:

```
The temperature in Fahrenheit is 77.0�F
```

Generated Response:
Yes, there is a method for simulating the oscillatory wave motions inside the dataset files. Specifically, the function that serves this purpose is named "sine", and it is located in the file `./codefolder/mat_code.py`. 

The "sine" function calculates the sine of an angle in radians, which inherently simulates the oscillatory behavior of a wave, as the sine function commonly represents waveforms such as sound and light waves.

Here are the relevant details from the codebase:
- **Function Name**: sine
- **File Path**: ./codefolder/mat_code.py
- **Purpose**: This function calculates the sine of an angle in radians. According to its docstring, "sine can simulate the oscillation of a wave."
- **Arguments**: `angle` (specifies the angle in radians for which the sine value is to be calculated)
- **Lines of Code**: The function is defined from line 29 to line 31 in `mat_code.py`.

This function allows you to generate values representing a sine wave by inputting various angles, which effectively simulates the oscillatory motion of a wave.

Generated Response:
Yes, there are several methods mentioned in the dataset files that are used for preventing overfitting in the context of training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). These methods can primarily be seen in `cnn.py` found in the `./codefolder`. Here are the details:

1. **Data Augmentation**:
   Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially expand the size of a dataset by creating modified versions of images in the dataset. This can help prevent overfitting by providing more diverse examples during training. The comments mentioned in the file suggest a series of these transformations:
   - Rotation of the image by 10 degrees.
   - Adjusting the sharpness of the image.
   - Horizontal and vertical translation of the image.
   - Shearing the image by 10 degrees.

   Although specific functions for these transformations are not listed here, comments in the dataset imply that these augmentations occur.

2. **Dropout**:
   In the `CNN` class (lines 61-103 in `cnn.py`), the docstring indicates that dropout is applied after each pooling layer and fully connected layer. This is a regularization method where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps in preventing overfitting by making the neural network less sensitive to the specific weights of neurons. This is described in:
   - Lines around dropouts such as "# Dropout with 25% probability" and "# Dropout with 50% probability."

Overall, these methods introduced in the design and training phase within the CNN class, together with the data augmentation processes implied, actively participate in combatting overfitting, ensuring a robust model capable of generalizing well on unseen data.
