Generated Response:
Based on the provided context and code snippets, there is no direct method within the dataset files that is specifically used for preventing overfitting. Overfitting prevention techniques are typically found within model training code, rather than dataset management code.

However, from the broader code repositories, there is a hint within the `cnn.py` file in the comments about data augmentation methods **that can prevent overfitting**. Data augmentation methods like rotating the image by 10 degrees, adjusting the sharpness of the image, translating the image horizontally and vertically, and shearing the image by 10 degrees are mentioned, which are common techniques to increase the diversity of training data and reduce overfitting. This mitigates overfitting by creating more robust and generalized models.

In the `CNN` class, listed under `cnn.py` and described in the docstring, dropout is also applied after each pooling layer and fully connected layer, another well-known method to prevent overfitting by randomly "dropping" units during the training process to prevent complex co-adaptations on training data. The `CNN` class is structured with three convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers with such overfitting countermeasures.

To summarize, while dataset files (`AircraftDataset`, `Animal`, etc.) contain no specific overfitting prevention methods, methods like data augmentation and dropout are part of the model training stage, specifically noted in `cnn.py` in the context of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Generated Response:
The function that can be used to simulate oscillatory wave motion, as per the descriptions given in the JSON data, is the `sine` function in the file located at `./codefolder\mat_code.py`. 

Here are the specific details from the provided JSON:

- **Function Name**: `sine`
- **File Path**: `./codefolder\mat_code.py`
- **Docstring**: "This function calculates the sine of an angle in radians. sine can simulate the oscillation of a wave."
- **Arguments**: `angle`
- **Lines**: Starting at line 29 and ending at line 31.

This function is explicitly documented to simulate the oscillation of a wave, which is typical for functions like sine that are periodic and represent wave-like motions. The sine function computes the sine value of an angle provided in radians, which can describe oscillations such as those found in sound waves, light waves, or other periodic phenomena.

### Code Context
The function is defined within a Python script that contains a total of 8 functions, all related to mathematical operations, such as calculating square roots, absolute values, factorials, logarithms, powers, and summing natural numbers. There are no classes within this file, as indicated by `"num_classes": 0` in the metadata.

No further specific code lines or details are provided for the implementation of the `sine` function besides its start and end lines, but based on the documentation, the function's role is clear in terms of wave simulation. 

To use this function to simulate oscillatory wave motion, it would typically be invoked with an angle in radians to get the corresponding sine value, which would help in modeling the waves.
