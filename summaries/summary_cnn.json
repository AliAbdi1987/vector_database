{"summary": "Overall File Summary:\nThis Python script is designed for training and evaluating a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset, which consists of handwritten digit images, using PyTorch.\n\n**Key Components:**\n1. **Data Handling**:\n   - **Transformations**: Two sets of transformations are defined; one for basic normalization and another with additional data augmentation techniques such as random rotation, sharpness adjustment, translation, and shearing to improve model generalization.\n   - **Datasets** and **Data\n\nDetailed Summaries:\nThe code element describes a Python class named `CNN`, representing a Convolutional Neural Network with architectural specifics given in the docstring. Here's a summary of the class and its components:\n\n1. **Class Name**: `CNN`\n2. **Description**: The `CNN` class implements a Convolutional Neural Network featuring:\n   - 3 convolutional layers.\n   - 3 fully connected layers.\n   - Dropout applied after each pooling layer and after each fully connected layer.\n   - Configuration of convolutional layers includes a sequence of 64, 64, 128, 128, 256, and 256 filters.\n   - Fully connected layers have sizes of 1024, 512, and 10 neurons.\n   -\nThe code element describes a Python function named `plot_misclassified`. It does not have a docstring provided for documentation. The function takes four arguments: `misclassified_images`, `misclassified_preds`, `misclassified_true`, and `num_images`. The function starts at line 194 and ends at line 223 in the source file. While the specific operations performed inside the function aren't detailed, based on the function's name and arguments, it likely involves plotting or visualizing a specified number (`num_images`) of misclassified images along with their predicted and true labels.\nThis JSON element describes a Python function named `__init__`. It has one argument, `self`, and does not have a docstring (documentation string) provided. The function begins at line 69 and ends at line 82 in the source code. This function is typically a constructor used for initializing new instances of a class.\nThe Python code element represents a function named `forward`. This function has two arguments: `self` and `x`. The function's implementation spans from line 84 to line 103 in the source file. There is no documentation string provided for this function (`\"docstring\": null`)."}
