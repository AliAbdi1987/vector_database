{"summary": "Overall File Summary:\nThe Python file defines a class named `Animal`. Within this class, the following components are present:\n\n1. An initializer `__init__()` that takes a parameter `name`, and assigns this to an instance variable `name`.\n2. A method `speak()` that raises a `NotImplementedError` when called. This is intended to enforce that subclasses of `Animal` should provide their own implementation of the `speak` method.\n3. A static method `fibonacci_sequence(n)`\n\nDetailed Summaries:\nThis JSON structure describes a Python class named `Animal`. The class has three methods: \n\n1. `__init__`: This is the constructor method of the class, taking arguments `self` and `name`. It is defined between lines 2 and 3 of the source code.\n\n2. `speak`: This method takes only the `self` argument and is defined between lines 5 and 6.\n\n3. `fibonacci_sequence`: This method takes an argument `n` and is defined between lines 8 and 9.\n\nThere is no documentation provided for the class or any of its methods (as indicated by `\"docstring\": null`). The entire class definition spans from line 1 to line 9 of the source code\nThe provided JSON object represents a Python function named `__init__`. It is a constructor method of a class (given its name), and it takes two arguments: `self` and `name`. The function does not have a docstring, and it spans from line 2 to line 3 in the source code. This constructor typically initializes a newly created object of the class with the provided `name` attribute.\nThe provided Python code element describes a function named `speak`. This function is a member of a class, suggested by the presence of `self` in its arguments. It starts on line 5 and ends on line 6, indicating it is likely a simple or empty function with minimal content. There is no documentation string (`docstring`) provided for this function.\nThe Python code element describes a function named `fibonacci_sequence`, which has a single parameter `n`. No docstring is provided to explain the function\u2019s purpose. The function's code starts at line 8 and ends at line 9."}
