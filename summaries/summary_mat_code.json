{"summary": "Overall File Summary:\nThe Python file contains a collection of mathematical functions designed to perform various calculations:\n\n1. **`square_root(num)`** - Calculates the square root of a given number using the `math.sqrt` method.\n2. **`absolute_value(num)`** - Returns the absolute value of a given number using Python's built-in `abs` function.\n3. **`factorial(num)`** - Computes the factorial of a given number using `math.factorial`.\n4. **`logarithm(num\n\nDetailed Summaries:\nThe code element describes a function named `square_root`. It is designed to calculate the square root of a number. The function has one argument, `num`. It starts at line 4 and ends at line 6 in the source code. The function includes a docstring that explains its functionality.\nThe provided JSON element represents a Python function named `absolute_value`. This function is documented with a docstring that explains its purpose: to calculate the absolute value of a number. It takes one argument, `num`. The function's code spans from line 9 to line 11 in the source file.\nThe Python code element describes a function named \"factorial\" that calculates the factorial of a number. It takes one argument, \"num\". The function's implementation starts at line 14 and ends at line 16. The function includes a docstring which explains that it computes the factorial of a number.\nThe Python code element represents a function named `logarithm`, which calculates the logarithm of a number with a base of 10. It accepts one argument, `num`. The function is defined between lines 19 and 21 of the source code, and its purpose is described in the accompanying docstring.\nThe Python code element represents a function named `power`. It is designed to calculate the power of a number, as described in its documentation string. The function takes two arguments: `base` and `exponent`. Its code starts on line 24 and ends on line 26 in the source file.\nThe Python code element represents a function named `sine`. This function is designed to calculate the sine of an angle provided in radians. It is documented to potentially simulate the oscillation of a wave. The function only takes one argument, `angle`. The function is defined from line 29 to line 31 in the source code.\nThe element describes a Python function named `fibonacci_sequence`. This function is designed to calculate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms, which is provided as an argument (`n`). The function starts at line 34 and ends at line 41 in the source code. The provided docstring explains the purpose of the function.\nThis code element describes a Python function named `sum_first_100_natural_numbers` which is designed to calculate the sum of the first 100 natural numbers. The function does not take any arguments (indicated by `\"args\": []`) and is documented with a docstring that explains its purpose. It starts at line 44 and ends at line 46 in the source code."}
