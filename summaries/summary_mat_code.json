{"summary": "Overall File Summary:\nThe Python file defines several mathematical functions using the `math` module:\n\n1. **square_root(num)**: Calculates and returns the square root of a given number using `math.sqrt`.\n2. **absolute_value(num)**: Returns the absolute value of a given number using `abs`.\n3. **factorial(num)**: Computes and returns the factorial of a given number using `math.factorial`.\n4. **logarithm(num)**: Calculates and returns the base-10 logarithm of a given number using `math.log10`.\n5. **power(base, exponent)**: Returns the result of raising `base` to the power of `exponent` using `math.pow`.\n6. **sine(angle)**: Calculates and returns the\n\nDetailed Summaries:\nThe given Python code element represents a function named `square_root` that takes one argument `num`. There is no documentation string provided for this function (`docstring` is `null`). The purpose of this function, based on its name, is likely to calculate the square root of the given argument `num`.\nThe element describes a function named `absolute_value` which takes one argument `num`. The function lacks a docstring, meaning there is no documentation or description provided within the code about what the function does or how it works.\nThe Python code element represents a function named `factorial` which takes one argument, `num`. The function currently does not have a docstring, so there is no description or explanation of what the function does provided within the code element itself.\nThe Python code element represents a function named `logarithm`, which takes one argument `num`. It does not have a docstring that explains its purpose or usage.\nThe provided element describes a Python function named `power` which takes two arguments named `base` and `exponent`. There is no documentation string (`docstring`) provided for this function. The function is intended to perform operations related to raising a number (`base`) to a power (`exponent`).\nThe Python code element describes a function named \"sine\" that takes one argument named \"angle\". There is no documentation string (docstring) provided for this function.\nThe element represents a Python function named `fibonacci_sequence`, which has one argument `n`. There is no documentation string provided for this function in its definition.\nThe Python code element describes a function named `sum_first_100_natural_numbers`. This function takes no arguments (`args` is an empty list) and does not have a documentation string (`docstring` is null). The purpose of the function can be inferred from its name, which suggests it calculates the sum of the first 100 natural numbers."}
