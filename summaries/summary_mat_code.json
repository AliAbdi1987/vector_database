{"summary": "Overall File Summary:\nThe Python file contains definitions for several mathematical functions. Here's a summary of their purposes:\n\n1. **square_root(num)**: Calculates and returns the square root of the specified number using the `math.sqrt` function.\n\n2. **absolute_value(num)**: Returns the absolute value of the specified number using the `abs` function.\n\n3. **factorial(num)**: Computes the factorial of the specified number using the `math.factorial` function.\n\n4. **logarithm(num)**:\n\nDetailed Summaries:\nThe Python code element describes a function named `square_root`. This function is designed to calculate the square root of a number provided as an argument (`num`). The function definition starts at line 4 and ends at line 6 in the code, and it includes a documentation string that explains its purpose.\nThe Python code element represents a function named `absolute_value`. This function is designed to calculate the absolute value of a number provided as an argument (`num`). The function starts at line 9 and ends at line 11 in the source code. Its purpose and usage are briefly explained in a docstring that states, \"This function calculates the absolute value of a number.\"\nThe code element provided describes a function named `factorial`. This function is designed to calculate the factorial of a number, which is specified by the argument `num`. The function begins on line 14 and ends on line 16 of the code. The included docstring (\"This function calculates the factorial of a number.\") explains the purpose of the function.\nThe provided JSON object describes a Python function named `logarithm`. This function calculates the logarithm of a number using base 10. The function has one argument, `num`. The function is defined from line 19 to line 21 in the code file. The documentation string (docstring) provides a brief description of what the function does.\nThe Python code element describes a function named `power`. This function calculates the power of a number. It takes two arguments: `base` and `exponent`. The function begins at line 24 and ends at line 26.\nThe code element represents a function named `sine`. It is designed to calculate the sine of an angle, which is provided in radians. The function specifically aims to simulate the oscillation of a wave, as noted in its documentation string. The function has one argument, named `angle`, and the code for this function spans from line 29 to line 31 in the source file.\nThe code element describes a Python function named `fibonacci_sequence`. It calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms, denoted by the argument `n`. The function begins at line 34 and ends at line 41.\nThe element describes a Python function named `sum_first_100_natural_numbers`. It contains a documentation string stating that the function is used to calculate the sum of the first 100 natural numbers. It takes no arguments and spans from line 44 to line 46 in the source code."}
